# EmployeeAttrition
Employee attrition is an important factor for any organization with help of AI we can predict whether an employee will leave the company or not. I had used the IBM dataset which is freely available on Kaggle.First I had cleaned the data and visualize it to see which columns affect the employee turnover most then I had done data preprocessing since data is small its good to split train and test as 70% and 30% respectively after that, I had tried a few promising models and I found that random-forest will work best. on testing on the test set we got 86% accurate which is great after that I had used various metrics to analyze the result and finally saved the model using the joblib package.
The next step of the project is to create an API and giving Ui for which I had used the FastApi package which is good for data science applications. It lies between Django and flask. It also provides built-in Ui which gives me an option to focus on code. Next, I had created a function that will take inputs and give a prediction for which I had used the model that I saved I had used the joblib package to read the model after that send the result to API. The last part of the project is to deploy it using Heroku, pythonaywhere platforms.
